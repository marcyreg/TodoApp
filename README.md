# ToDo List App 
###Class Activity

##App details
This week our focus was using the UITableViewController, Seques, passing local data between screens, adding items to a list, deleting items to a list, and finally implementing a delegate (in the view) to avoid the todo with less than 3 characters (this is yet to be completed as of 09/02/15).
This was coded in Swift 2.0 with Xcode 7 beta.
